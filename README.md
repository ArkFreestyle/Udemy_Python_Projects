# Simple Webscraper
This repository was going to contain all the projects I worked on when following the instructor in the Udemy course: "The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced!", however I only managed follow along for two projects: a web scraper and the FF-esque text based rpg, so this repo contains the webscraper.

EDIT: Okay, no it still contains all the projects I worked on. Uploaded:

# A calculator

# A Final Fantasy-esque text based RPG
This was fun.
